# 9.4 GCD: 

## The Problem
Calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two numbers.

## Hint
In mathematics, the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two or more integers is the largest positive integer that divides each of the integers. 

For example, the gcd of 8 and 12 is 4. Because 4 is the largest number that divides both 8 and 12.

Similarly, 15 is the gcd of 15 and 45. Because 15 divides both 15 and 45.

## The Solution
```python
def compute_gcd(x, y):
	smaller = min(x,y)
	gcd = 1
	for i in range(1, smaller+1):
		if((x % i == 0) and (y % i == 0)):
			gcd = i
	return gcd

num1 = int(input("Enter first number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter second number: "))

gcd = compute_gcd(num1, num2)

print("GCD of", num1,"and", num2,"is", gcd)
```

## Explanation
Since we are trying to find the number that divides both numbers, the dividing number will as big as the smallest number. 

Letâ€™s say you want to get the common divisor of 8 and 24. Their common divisor can not be higher than 8,because the numbers greater than 8 can not divide 8. Hence, the gcd will be smaller or equal to the smallest of the two numbers. 

So, inside the compute_gcd method, we are getting the smallest number by using the min function.

Then, we are running a for loop on the range. The range starts at 1 and goes until the smaller number. 

Inside the loop, we are dividing both numbers by i. If i divides both numbers, we update the gcd, otherwise, we keep going. 

Eventually, we return the gcd. That's it. 

## Recursive GCD
You can use a recursive method to calculate gcd. Just see the solution and know that you can also do it this way.

```python
def gcd(a,b):
    if(b==0):
        return a
    else:
        return gcd(b,a%b)
a=int(input("Enter first number:"))
b=int(input("Enter second number:"))
GCD=gcd(a,b)
print("GCD is: ", GCD)
```

## built-in GCD
Python has a built-in method to calculate gcd. You can use that one as well. 

```python
import math

a = int(input("Enter first number:"))
b = int(input("Enter second number:"))

gcd = math.gcd(a,b)
print(gcd)
```
