# 5. Solution Strategy

---

## Practice
The more problems you solve, the better developer you will become.

However, to become good at solving problems, you will need 3P(practice, patience, and perseverance).

## Read the problem
Whenever you start solving a new problem: 

Read the problem at least 3 times. Try to understand the problem. If there is a note, read that. And then, try to think about the problem in your own words. 

## Input-Output
The second step is to think about possible input and possible output. If possible, think about 3 inputs and their output. 

For example, if you think about the second largest number of a list...for the list below, 82 would be the answer.

`[31, 15, 34, 87, 22, 82, 56]`

## Write the steps
If you see a large problem for the first time, write the solution steps in a paper...This will save your time while coding. 

## Incremental
While coding, use the print command to see the output. Most of the time, write a few lines, and then write a print command to see the output. 

If you see the expected output, then delete the print command and go to the next step. 

## Comment
If you are solving a large problem, don’t forget to write a few useful comments...This will help you to debug.

## Google
Even if you have a solution, don’t consider it as the best solution. Instead, Google it. You will be surprised by seeing other people’s solution. You will learn a lot from other available solutions out there. 

## Keep doing
There is just one way to become good at problem-solving - Just solve more problems. 

## Take away
Keep solving more problems.
