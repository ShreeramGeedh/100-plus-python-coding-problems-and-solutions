# Math Power

## The problem
Take two numbers from the users. Calculate the result of second number power of the first number.

## Hints
To power, you will need to use two asterisks symbols (two multiplication symbols). For example 4 to the power 3 will be


`result = 4**3`

## Solution
```python
base_num = int(input('Give me the base number: '))
power_num = int(input('Give me the power number: '))
result = base_num ** power_num
print('Your result is: ', result)
```

## Think Different
Python has a built-in function named `pow`. The pow is a short form of the word power. And you can pass 2 numbers to the pow function. It will give you the second number as a power of the first number. 


## Alternative Solution
Python has a built-in function named pow. The pow is a short form of the word power. And you can pass 2 numbers to the pow function. It will give you the second number as a power of the first number. 

```python
base_num = int(input('Give me the base number: '))
power_num = int(input('Give me the power number: '))
result = pow(base_num, power_num)
print('Your result is: ', result)
```
